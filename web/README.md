# Git Slice Web

A lightweight landing page for Git Slice built with Vite and React. This static site is ready for local development and future integrations.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Create a production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview the build locally:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

5. Run end-to-end tests (starts the dev server automatically):

   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

The site will compile without errors and is ready to be deployed as a static bundle.
